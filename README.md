# Wine-Quality-Analysis

Create a wine quality prediction model by creating three different prediction models using logistic regression, 
Convolutional neural network (CNN), and Artificial Neural networks (ANN) and then picking the most accurate model for this data.

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

There are many factors that a wine tester looks into before deciding whether the white wine is worth 
it or not. A lot of chemical compounds are put while making the perfect wine which is why all chemicals must be balanced out 
exceptionally well for the quality of the white wine to be good. In order to aid in the prediction of the quality of wine, 
this research makes use of the red and white variants of the Portuguese “Vinho Verde” wine. The ability to predict the quality 
of the wine to a high accuracy would mean that there is less tasting needed which will save a lot of money and time spend in wine tasting. 
The dataset contains categorical and continuous data, which is why, logistic regression, 
Convolutional neural network (CNN), and Artificial Neural networks (ANN) are all suitable. 
Hence, in this research we compare the accuracy of these three models and create a system based on the most accurate model.

####  Result
            precision    recall  f1-score   support

         bad       0.93      0.30      0.45       330
        good       0.73      0.99      0.84       650

    accuracy                           0.76       980
   macro avg       0.83      0.64      0.65       980
weighted avg       0.80      0.76      0.71       980


The most accurate model from the three models was logistic regression. It had the best overall ROC AUC, as well as f1 score.
